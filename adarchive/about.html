        dedicated to showcasing the use of women's bodies in magazine advertisements throughout the late 20th century. This website is a curated collection of magazine ads that highlights the ways in which women's bodies have been used as a commodity to sell products.

        This website features a range of ads from the 1970s to the 1990s, a time when women's liberation movements were beginning to gain traction. Despite the push for women's equality, advertisements of the time often perpetuated gender stereotypes, objectifying and sexualizing women to sell products.
        
        By exploring these ads, we hope to provide a historical context for the ways in which women have been viewed in advertising media. this collection includes ads from a range of industries, including fashion, beauty, food, and household products, allowing visitors to see the ways in which women's bodies have been used to sell a variety of goods.
        
        Through this website, visitors can gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which gender norms and stereotypes have been perpetuated in advertising media, and the impact that this has had on societal views of women. Additionally, we hope to encourage critical thinking about contemporary advertising practices and the continued use of women's bodies in advertising media today.
        
        Overall, this archival website provides a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of advertising and the role of women in media. We hope that this collection will inspire visitors to engage with the past, while also promoting critical reflection on the present and future of advertising media.
